# Notary Gadget Auto-Clicker

## Introduction
I have been using Notary Gadget for a while, but a few years ago, I became lazy about updating the database. With more than 500 entries to update, I knew I would never find the willingness to do it manually. Hence, I created this auto-clicker script.

## Requirements
You'll need the following software installed on your system:
- Python
- Google Chrome
- Selenium

## Installation Instructions

### 1. Install Python
1. Download the latest version of Python from the [official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
2. Run the installer and ensure you check the box that says "Add Python to PATH".
3. Follow the prompts to complete the installation.

### 2. Install Google Chrome
1. Download Google Chrome from the [official website](https://www.google.com/chrome/).
2. Run the installer and follow the prompts to complete the installation.

### 3. Install Selenium
1. Open Command Prompt (press `Win + R`, type `cmd`, and hit Enter).
2. Install Selenium using pip:
   ```bash
   pip install selenium
   ```

### 4. Download ChromeDriver
1. Go to the [ChromeDriver download page](https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/downloads).
2. Download the version that matches your installed version of Chrome.
3. Extract the downloaded file and place the `chromedriver.exe` in a directory of your choice.

## Setup Instructions

1. Save the auto-clicker script files in a directory of your preference.
2. Open the script files and update the path to the `chromedriver.exe` to match its location on your system.
3. Hardcode your credentials in the script where indicated.

## Running the Script

1. Open Command Prompt and navigate to the directory where you saved the script files. For example:
   ```bash
   cd path\to\your\script\directory
   ```
2. Run the script by typing:
   ```bash
   python <the_name_of_your_file.py>
   ```

## Debugging
The script includes some debugging prompts in case something goes wrong. Follow the prompts to troubleshoot any issues.
