Notary Gadget Auto-Clicker

I have been using Notary Gadget for a while, but a few years ago, I became lazy about updating the database. With more than 500 entries to update, I knew I would never find the willingness to do it manually. Hence, I created this auto-clicker script.

You'll need Python, Google Chrome (the easiest web browser to work with), and Selenium.

I won't go into all the details on how to install the above requirements; I'm lazy...

Once you have those installed, save the scripts in a directory of your preference. Make sure the path to the ChromeDriver is updated in the scripts and that you have hardcoded your credentials as well.

Open a terminal in that directory, then run:

python <the_name_of_your_file.py>



And that's it! There are some debugging prompts in case something goes south....
